            <header2><strong>About Me</strong></header2>
            <p>I am a student at Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies in the program of Computere Programming. I am certified in different areas such as Python and Excel. But I am learning more in-depth like markdown, virtualization, game development and HTML at my time in my highschool. Along side my academics, I strive to be more involved with my community. I can get more involved by finding out ways to volunteer at non-profit events and helping with smaller positions in organizations such as my local Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Going into a technical school, I thought I was just going to learn about hard skills like coding, navigating and anything related to Information Technology. But I realized that soft skills are just as important going into highschool and anywhere else in the world. Being able to communicate and speak clearly others, listening when others are speaking and understanding their words, all together they make up a great person not in just the workplace but in the world. I am very grateful for these lessons in highschool and hope to put great use to them. </p>
            <p>I have chosen to strive for the career path of game development. Video games are the biggest reason why I have chosen this path. I take a look at my personality and habits and realize that I always like to see the results of my hardwork. By taking this path, I am able to see how much it can impact and help others through my future code and projects.</p>
