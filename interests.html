    <ul>
        <li>Video games: I have a great passion when it comes to not just one specific game but the whole gaming industry. I've had this hobby ever since elementary school.</li>
        <li>Technology: After my great hobby of video games, I have struck an interest toward anything with technology. Getting to learn and see how everything works in the background of games and the devices I use on a daily basis amazes me. This led to my interests with technology.</li>
        <li>Data: I have learned a lot about technology along with math and logic. This led to me interested in anything that is related to data like investing or even statstics about TV shows.</li>
        <li>Psychology: Branching off of data, psychology is a really big part in a human's life. Using data, I can learn about the average human's psychology and how they think, act and learn.</li>
        <li>Fashion: Fashion can be connected to psychology in a way. Maybe how your surroundings influence what you like. However, I'm really interested in fashion because the clothes I wear can change my mood. For example, feeling confident in casual school clothes or the feeling of being a professional in the workplace with business casual clothing.</li>
